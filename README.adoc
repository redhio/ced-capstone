# ced-capstone
Dec-2017
This is our Certified Ethereum Developer CED Capstone Project for the Blockchainhub.
This project is to show how an external remote service can be governed by blockchain smart contracts.  
A series of service and state contracts govern the interactions, while a remote service bridge initiates the remote service and returns the results to the smart contract.

== Iris Prediction
The service that is used in this test is a simple well know exmaple machine learning model, which predicts the type of IRIS flower based on three input parameters.  The details can be found https://bigml.com/api

inputs: petal length, petal width, sepal length

outputs: a prediction

== Setup
node install remixd
remixd -S .\contracts

git commit -a
git push origin master

== Install
The compiled files for the ced-capstone dapp.

To install run:

```
./deploy.bat
```

Restart Parity and you'll see ced-capstone in the list of Dapps!

== Requirements

This Dapp requires Parity with signer enabled or Metamask.

== Using the contracts
1. Send 1 eth to 0x009
2. Provide input data 2,4,5
3. Confirm transaction
4. Receive the answer, which is 2
