# ced-capstone
Dec-2017
This is our Certified Ethereum Developer CED Capstone Project for the Blockchainhub.
This project is to show how an external remote service can be governed by blockchain smart contracts.  
A series of service and state contracts govern the interactions, while a remote service bridge initiates the remote service and returns the results to the smart contract.

The service that is used in this test is a simple well know exmaple machine learning model, which predicts the type of IRIS flower based on 3 https://bigml.com/api
inputs:
petal length
petal width
sepal length
outputs:
iris prediction
